# Workflow Pattern Classification

## Purpose
A classification system for the different types of workflow patterns used in Nenjo routines. This guide helps agents and humans choose the right structure for a given problem.

## Core Workflow Patterns

| Pattern            | Description                                                                 | Best Used When                                      | Key Characteristics |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Linear Pipeline** | Simple sequential execution of steps                                        | Work naturally flows in a fixed order               | No branching, predictable path |
| **Gated Pipeline**  | Sequential steps with validation gates at key points                        | Quality, safety, or compliance must be checked      | Explicit pass/fail decisions |
| **Fan Out**         | Parallel independent work followed by aggregation or review                 | Multiple independent analyses or generations needed | Parallel execution + join step |
| **Review Pipeline** | Generation → Review → Approval/Rejection path                               | Output quality or compliance requires human/agent review | Explicit pass/fail routing |
| **Decomposition**   | Leader breaks work into subtasks assigned to specialists                    | Complex work that benefits from division of labor   | Clear subtask boundaries |
| **Council**         | Structured multi-agent collaboration with defined delegation strategy       | Multiple perspectives or synthesis are required     | Leader + members with roles |
| **Adversarial**     | One agent proposes, another critiques, leader decides                       | High-stakes decisions requiring critical thinking   | Built-in challenge mechanism |
| **Bounded Iterative** | Repeated generation + gate evaluation with a bounded retry loop            | Creative or optimization work with a retry budget   | Gate `on_fail` loop with optional `max_attempts` and final escalation |

## Decision Framework

Use this classification guide when designing routines:

1. Start with **Linear Pipeline** if the work is simple and sequential.
2. Add **Gates** if validation is required at key stages.
3. Use **Fan Out** when parallel independent work improves speed or quality.
4. Choose **Review Pipeline** when output quality matters.
5. Use **Council** when multiple perspectives or synthesis are genuinely needed.
6. Consider **Decomposition** or **Adversarial** for complex or high-stakes work.
7. For platform routines, keep ordinary flow acyclic. Use cycles only for bounded gate `on_fail` retry loops; set `max_attempts` only when overriding the default retry budget.

## Notes
This classification guide is intentionally extensible. New patterns can be added as the platform evolves.
